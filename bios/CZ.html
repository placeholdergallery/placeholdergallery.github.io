		<i>Charlotte Zhang</i></br>
		b. 1999</br>
		Charlotte Zhang is an artist, filmmaker, and occasional writer interested in reenactments of shared fantasy, social scripts produced by spectacle, the libidinal investments and erotic economies which undergird state-sanctioned violence and other practices of nation-building, the perpetual collapse of punishment and celebration; vengeance.
