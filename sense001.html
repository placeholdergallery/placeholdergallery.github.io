The gun going off<br>
The random back fire….. appears as random as asking<br><br>
	—Erica Hunt, “Mourning Birds”<br><br>

<i>What if we built a force field?</i> asked then 24-year-old Palmer Luckey and 33-year-old Trae Stephens of the US-Mexico Border in 2016. This, to be clear, was to ask: <i>How can we send more forces to the field?</i> Of course, <i>this</i> is a very old question. See, the latter formulation brings to light that there is an ongoing war between forces and the field. The task for Luckey and Stephens, then, is to defeat the field. They must make the field incapacitated. <br><br>
It seems, however, that the ancient field is somehow always pregnant. Even when reduced to rubble, genocided, something remains and regenerates–children are willed. Luckey and Stephens, founder of Oculus and Partner at Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund respectively, realized that they needed to democratize their despotism to meet this perennial pregnancy of the field. The children of the fields, fieldhands, needed to be invited to the lab. So the fieldhands became Border Patrol Agents. In 2017, Luckey and Stephens inaugurated Anduril Industries, military contractor vying for dominion de jure of a Southern force field, above this very integration. 
Between the ambits of 32-foot surveillance towers, Anduril invites fieldhands to step under virtual reality (VR) headsets for the production of hundreds more fields of vision to complete its generalism. The children of the field are turned into the field’s overseers. They catch aberrations in the field, like siblings traversing the field. Coaxed from their guerilla neighborhoods, fieldhands stand under their headsets and fragment the field. They transform the field into bits, tearing the field. Mother and child are therefore pulled apart, nigh blotting, to take Frederick Douglass’ language, the fact of the relationship from memory. <br><br>
The headset is a whirlwind. At first, the fieldhand is decapitated. The device encumbers her head, replacing everything vital in its scope. Green captions produce a new vestibular system, of both balance and culture. The fieldhand now wades in a virtual valley. <i>PERSON 98%</i>, it tells her when she looks down at the glowing square which has replaced her feet. She is no longer mobile, no longer political–there is nothing to be done. No way to avoid the tear. <br><br>
An ox weighs on her tongue, the fieldhand. There is nothing to be done. She waits for a fire to light up the darkness which has suddenly washed the field. Somebody save her! The child’s superior is perched on her cheeks so she cannot close her eyes up tight…and sleep. There is no spectatorial sovereignty as long as the eyes above her eyes, the third eyes, remind her that she is always being watched and watching. Slowly, the headset unearths everything that was once familiar, every bit of the field. The fieldhand sees her mother exposed before her, and she is destroyed. Somehow, yet, there is still a voice churning through the flat desert winds. The child eventually finds her mother’s cadence and unites with her in whispering: “I’ve only got words for those in the know, / for the others, I can’t remember anything.”<br><br>
